# Measuring Time and Space complexity of a Fibonacci algorithm: Recursive vs. Iterative

In this assignment, I will be comparing the time and space complexity between the iterative and recursive approach to the Fibonacci sequence.
Let's first start by showing how the iterative and recursive approach of finding the nth value in a Fibonacci sequence works.

## Recursive
A recursive function is defined as a function that calls itself during its execution once or more. This function is very useful for many different types of problems as it allows programmers to write very efficient programs using minimal amount code. Below is an example of a recursive function used to find the nth value of a Fibonacci sequence:<br>

## Iterative
An iterative program is a program that runs its code repeitively until a specific wanted end result is achieved.
Below is an example of an iterative program used to find the nth value of a Fibonnaci sequence:


##Testing

In this section, I will be testing the functionality of my recursive and iterative codes:
